# Chatbot Project

This project is a chatbot built using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow, integrated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The chatbot can interact with users through a GUI built with Tkinter.

## Features

- Processes natural language input to provide meaningful responses.
- Uses machine learning to classify user queries and generate responses based on predefined intents.
- Includes a graphical user interface for ease of interaction.
- Includes model training with data preprocessing and intent classification.

## Project Structure

- **intents.json**: Contains the training data (intents and patterns).
- **Modified_Code.py**: The main Python file that includes data preprocessing, model training, and chatbot response generation.
- **words.pkl** and **classes.pkl**: Pickle files used to store the vocabulary and intent categories after preprocessing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **NLTK**: For tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing words in the sentences.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
